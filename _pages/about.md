I’m a senior research assistant at AI Media Centre (AIM) at the School of Communication, Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU).

I’m particularly interested in understanding and finding new insights from NLP(Natural Language Processing) and LLM (Large Language Model). 

Research Field: Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Computational Semantics

My most recent works are focused on readability and nominalization.
